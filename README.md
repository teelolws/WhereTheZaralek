# WhereTheZaralek

In Zaralek Caverns, when a zone-wide announcement goes out about an event spawning, this will set a waypoint to that event for you.

Currently only English game clients are supported. Want to help make this work in your language? Create an issue and provide me with the zone-wide announcements that go out in your language. Eg: Hungry Hungry Hydra - "A starving hydra emerges from the lava, looking for a quick meal!"
